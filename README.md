# Pac-Man-Factory
MIT xPro Coding Challenge - Pac-Man Factory

In this coding challenge, I am going to create PacMen with a click button and each of them will move around the browser window at their own pace.
This coding challenge requires knowledge of the array methods and manipulating the DOM.

For further development, I will turn it into a Pac-Man game.
