# Pac-Man-Factory
MIT xPro Coding Challenge - Pac-Man Factory

In this coding challenge, I am going to create PacMen with the click of a button and each of them will move about the browser window at their own pace.

In this coding challenge, I will create a web page that produces a Pac-Man on the click of a button by using the array methods and manipulating the DOM.
